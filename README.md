# Blackvue Downloader
Once you update the IP in the blackvue-downloader.py and run it, it will connect to your dashcam and download as many videos as it can.

It will ignore Parked recordings (video names ending in PF or PN), and downloads videos oldest (most likely to be removed from the SD card) to newest.

It will also check what files it already has, including any that have half downloaded, and will resume those.
